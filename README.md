# Matcha Finder

Matcha Finder is a single-page web application where users can search for matcha by location, create a secure account, curate a personalized favorites list, where they can also review and rate results.

The app's interactivity is centered around the top navigation bar, featuring a search bar and various event-driven actions throughout the page. Users are greeted with the site's calming color palette of beige and green hues, complemented by picture cards showcasing matcha flavor pairings.

Users will feel that they're on a multi-page app as React's routing system changes the URL and re-renders components. Both React hooks, useState and useEffect are used for responsive navigation showing real-time updates during user interaction.
